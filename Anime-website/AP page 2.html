      <h2 class="Subheader2">Big Three</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph2">The Big Three, in anime communities, typically means the three biggest anime that are impossible to know nothing about if you're a fan of anime. The first of the original Big Three was
      Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden, written by Kishimoto, due to its considerable size and popularity, pumping out 720 episodes and 11 standalone/ canon movies. Within its many episodes there are plenty of thrilling fights,
      funny moments and tense, bone-chilling scenes however sprinkled through this anime is almost increasingly lacklustre filler episodes. The show "boasts" a 41% filler rate, I use the quotation marks loosely as this was a
      big turn-off for a lot of Naruto fans and current day still stops new fans from starting it due to the daunting number of episodes. Another of the Big Three is One Piece, originally airing in 1999 the show now has an
      impressive record of 1011 episodes and has no intention of slowing down as the manga author has plans to finish around 2024/25 which will keep the anime going for years to come. Will Luffy ever get pirate king?
      Or are we all watching it because of the countless unique characters that keep us on our toes throughout the series? Zoro, I'm looking at you! The final of the Big Three, Bleach, took a much darker approach with the main plot
      surrounding shinigami, souls and other underworld type demons and beings. This anime isn't nearly as big as the other two at only 366 episodes, however in October 2022 the long awaited and highly anticipated Thousand Year Blood War
      is finally being released after being canceled in 2012 with no conclusive episodes.</p>

      <h2 class="Subheader2">Progress</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph2">As time progresses and anime changes the Big Three has changed through the years from the original trio to newcomers who have gripped the four corners of the world. Some examples are pieces of work like
      Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demonslayer) and Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia). The new age of anime was to be expected with the improvements of animation styles and technology to aid artists' visions
      as well as society progressing and forcing a new wave with the new generation. Anime of the Big Three that managed to stay relevant through the decades start with Naruto's ongoing spin off series Boruto wihch focuses on his son with his
      "New Generation" of shinobi in the Hidden Leaf Village, another is One Piece which is still airing after over 20 years.</p>
