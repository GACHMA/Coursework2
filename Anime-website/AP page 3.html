        <h2 class="Subheader3">Video Games</h2>
        <p class="Paragraph3">Video games have long been influenced by surrounding media including manga and anime. A huge example would be the effect Kentaro Miura's Berserk had on a whole franchise basically raising it from the ground up.
        The creation of Dark Souls, Demon Souls and other games in that universe (like newly released Elden Ring) have many thanks to give to Miura due to the content FromSoftware drew from the manga. One of the biggest transfers of artwork
        being Guts' Greatsword which many players from these games use if they are vying to use a strength build. Elden Ring has direct homage's confirmed by director Hidetaka Miyazaki like the Hill of Swords which can be found at multiple locations
        on the Elden Ring map. Guts even seems to get an appearance in the game with the existence of Blaidd the half-wolf who has his own questline to follow alongside a witch with a big hat; a clear reference to Guts and a past quest partner in Berserk.
        Blaidd has a calm demeanour and fights much like Guts wielding the same weapon so fans of both franchises immediately drew the similarities between the characters.</p>
