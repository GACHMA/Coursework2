        <p class="Paragraph4">With the rise of anime there came with it anime conventions. Proof that conventions shaped history comes with examples like world-famous San Diego Comic-Con,
        PAX Expo and WorldCon which are for gaming information and speculative fiction, respectively. Each convention has panels, artists and fans that are all able to meet and share ideas
        and just generally enjoy a space specifically for their hobby. One of the earliest conventions was for science fiction, taking place in 1936 and led to a meeting 3 years later for the world's first WorldCon.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">In 1941 a very brief rival of WorldCon emerged with the name Boskone and was referred to as the "winter WorldCon" however only stayed for 5 years. It was later revived in the 60s though
        due to new management more than 20 years down the line.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">With the arrival of the 50s came the arrival of Disclave, a science fiction convention that had no more than 22 individuals show during the first meeting.
        As time progressed, the convention gained more traction and the likes of George R.R. Martin, the creator of popular title Game of Thrones, even turned out. The convention unfortunately went through a tragic demise
        in 1997 when an act of vandalism at the event caused a fire alarm to go off sending the hotel complex hosting the event into a flooded area. Even though it was proved to not be the fault of the Disclave crew the
        convention was ended as there were no voluntary hosts for it anymore, sealing its doomed fate and never being reprised.</p>

        <p class="Paragraph4">To give a brigther tone, one of the first conventions that featured anime specific content was Lunacon. Originally beginning in 1957 anime didn't get a feature until the 80s with Star Blazers,
        an American version of Space Battleship Yamato. This would later help set the tone specifically for anime conventions in the future.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">An explosion of interest at the start of the 60s, with the reintroduction of superheroes and introduction of giant monsters with nuclear power potential, i.e. Godzilla, came 17 brand new conventions in one decade.
        An unprecendented occurence in the history of conventions as that more than doubled the amount of conventions that came out in the 30 years prior to this time period. One of the biggest names during this decade was Stan Lee as he released
        the first issue of Fantastic Four and managed to save Marvel Comics from going brankrupt, which they were on the verge of beforehand.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">The Lucca Comic Convention's arrival sparked cons to shift their main focus finding great success with comic books. Set in Lucca, Italy, this area gained great significance among European fans and later became the
        home of an awards show for comic creators and game creators alike. It is the second largest convention to date, second only to Japan's own, Comiket.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">Comiket is less popular amongst Westernised conceptions of conventions but it is most defintely the largest in the world, raking in more than 500,000 attendees yearly. The difference between this con and others was
        the sheer scale of individual creators who went to sell their ideas, either original or dervied from inspiration. The likes of Hellsing and Neon Genesis Evangelion both found their start from the panels at Comiket, leading to mainstream
        manga and anime being created for the concepts.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="Paragraph4">After the inital start of comic conventions they started to develop their own niches with specific cons for solo pieces of work. Some such examples to exist are Gallifrey One, a Doctor Who convention, Starfleet International
        Conference, this one being for Star Trek and other less mainstream conventions came to rise as well. As for the future of conventions, it's almost a certainty that anime cons will be around for a while due to their rise in popularity over the past
        couple decades, so all you weebs can rest easy, if you haven't attended one yet you can find one anywhere in the world almost every single weekend.</p>
