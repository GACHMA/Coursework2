          <h2 class="Subheader">The Birth</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">To find the answer of how Anime came about in the first place we need to take a little trip to Japan, the originating country.
          The first official animated film came out in Japan in 1971 and marked Oten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Houchi and Seitaro Kitayama as the Fathers of this medium.
          This, however, was not the beginning of anime, rather we'd need to go back in time just over 100 years to see how anime was first portrayed.
          The beginning of Anime was not a smooth, effortless ride. Rather it was full of struggle and pain. The first example of struggle early anime experienced was
          the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 which destroyed many anime film reels which were subsequently destroyed by the bombings in World War 2,
          leaving the early years of anime a blur for anyone that didn't live in this timeline.</p>

          <h2 class="Subheader">The War</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">During the war, the Japanese used anime to spread propaganda, which saw the release of their first ever full-length propoganda film,
          Momotaro: Sacred Sailors. Toei Animation bought company Japan Animated Films, that started in 1948, in 1956 which led to full length colour films being made.
          The first of that kind being one running for 78 minutes named The Tale of the White Serpent. The importance of this film was the fact that it was the
          first of its kind exported to America which was irrefutable proof of being able to make money over in the West. Once World War 2 reached the climax and the two
          atomic bombs were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, it lead to a new genre of apocalypse-type anime's coming from popular artists such as Katsuhiro Otomo who
          created a post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo based film Akira which was instrumental in letting Japanese people portray their experiences to teach the world. </p>

          <h2 class="Subheader">1950's: The Split</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">Commonly known today as the 'God of Manga', Osamu Tezuka first worked at Toei in the 1950's but by the latter half of the decade he had
          already built his split cell group to take with him to start his own studio. This studio was Mushi Production, or Mushi Pro, and is the birthplace of many creations such as
          Princess Knight, Dororo, and Astro Boy, a highly popular film that underwent its own Westernised adaptations.</p>

          <h2 class="Subheader">1980's: The Golden Age</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">During the 80's there was a drastic increase of interest in anime. More genres were put forward and the viewing quality of products also increased as the
          release of the VHS meant people could watch anime in the comfort of their own homes now, rather than having to watch it in theatres. This decade saw the release of one of the
          most successful and heard about anime's, Dragon Ball, animated by Toei Animation, one of the founding animation companies. We also had games like Mario Brothers come to light,
          further strengthening this very popular medium.</p>

          <h2 class="Subheader">1990's: The Downfall</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">Market crash. 1991. Economical stress for Japan in the 90s with many animation companies forced to close their doors for good. However due to the Golden Age of Anime
          it was better known around the world and so survived the rough times. After the struggle at the beginning of the decade the anime world was soon blessed with Neon Genesis Evangelion,
          changing a complete subsection of anime forever back in 1995. 1997 was an astronomical year as this year came with the release of Pokemon, one of the most popular anime franchises to date.
          There have been many versions released from the creators of this game spanning all the way to present day which shows off its incredible relevance in anime today with many anime's taking
          inspiration from characters found in the original games as well as the style and other overhanging themes. </p>

          <h2 class="Subheader">2000's: CGI Arrives</h2>
          <p class="Paragraph">As animation techniques improved one that became prevalent was CGI, using computers to animate scenes instead of drawing by hand. The release of the Big 3 heightened the
          expectations for anime by releasing games, manga and merchandise alongside the anime. With the increase in software ability we now had the Internet at our fingertips with which we could
          use to discuss with other fan's of the same anime and thus online communities began as well. However this meant that new anime that came out would be discussed to the most very minute
          details and so animators and studios had to up their games so new fans would be brought in and so old fans didn't fade away.</p>
